## Consider a Desktop Email Client

Several players participate primarily through web clients (like gmail.com). There's nothing wrong with this if it works for you. However, many more experienced players use desktop clients (like thunderbird). Desktop clients can make it easier to read and format more complex messages as well as filter messages for information.

## Setting up filters

You probably don't want Agora messages to go straight to your inbox. It's recommended to filter them to their own folder. Some clients also support tags and color coding emails. All of these things will make it easier for you to keep up and keep organized, so spending some time setting them up will pay off.

### Gmail

[Gmail's filters](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en) should be configured to ensure no emails go to spam.

The following filter will capture ALL agora emails:

    list:(agora-business.agoranomic.org) OR list:(agora-discussion.agoranomic.org) OR list:(agora-official.agoranomic.org) OR list(agora@listserver.tue.nl)
    
Apply this filter and mark 'never send to spam'. You can also apply a label and skip inbox if you want all Agora emails to go to a different folder.

If you're fulfilling an office it can be useful to create filters to find emails related to it. Here's an example filter to catch votes:

    (list:(agora-business.agoranomic.org OR list:(agora-business.agoranomic.org)) AND (assessor OR promotor OR for OR against OR present OR endorse)

## Mailing List Ettiquette

Agora is generally not very prescriptive about emails, but there are some things that help keep it more readable and organized for everyone. Below is a general list of suggestions:

### Bottom-Post Replies

There are two main ways to reply to emails: bottom-posting and top-posting, simply named for whether your reply goes above or below the original message. Most web clients now default to top-posting, but since Agora often involves responding to multiple sections of replies, bottom-posting is more readable. Desktop clients can generally be set to bottom-post be default.

### Quote only what you need

Trim the parts of a message you aren't responding to out of your reply. This makes your reply more readable and avoids the messages getting longer and longer. On most desktop clients, if you highlight a section of the message before hitting reply it will trim the quote down to only the highlighted part.
