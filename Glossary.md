## Agora-isms

Things that are typical to Agora, though not necessarily legally codified.

### Spivak Pronouns

Agora uses a type of neutral pronoun called Spivak for all players. This is simply e/em/eir.

### -or

Agora tends to name offices by taking a regular title and replacing -er with -or. For example: Rulekeepor, Webmastor, Treasuror.

### Proto

A proto (or protoproposal, or protosal) is an unfinished draft of a proposed rule change, submitted for feedback.

## Abbreviations

### CFJ

Call for Judgment. When there's confusion about something, players initiate a CFJ on a statement. Another player will judge the statement to resolve the confusion. CFJ### refers to a specific case.

### CoE

Claim of Error. Used to note that a player thinks there's something wrong on a report. The officer who made the report has to respond by denying or fixing the error.

### CotC

Clerk of the Courts. Currently doesn't formally exist, but this person tracks CFJs.

### FLR

Full Logical Ruleset. All of the rules and annotations that include when they were edited and how.

### ISIDTID

I say I do, therefore I do. This is how many actions work, but some are more restricted. Usually this comes up when people are debating whether an action can be done just by saying "I do X".

### MMI

Mother, May I? This refers to the rules that give special meaning to phrases like CAN, SHALL, and SHOULD in the ruleset.

### NttPF

Not to the Public Forum. Usually used when a player sends a message that looks like it's supposed to be an action, but they sent it to Agora-Discussion and so it is ineffective.

### SLR

Short Logical Ruleset. Just the rules, with minimal annotation.

### TTttPF

This time to the Public Forum. Usually used when someone first sent a message to Agora Discussion. If they quote that message and say this in Agora Business (or Agora Official) it means they take those actions.
